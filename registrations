# Since AEMO will not give us a list of power station locations, use the
# Geoscience Australia list to try to work out where the AEMO registered generators are.
#
# This script does the following things:
#   Download the AEMO Registration and Exemption list for the NEM, and extract the Generators list.
#   Download the Geoscience Australia list of power stations and extract the locations.
#   Run the Java tool that tries to match up AEMO stations with GA locations, or else uses a manual match.
#
# Dependencies:
#   curl
#   perl (simpler tools like sed have different command line switches between GNU/Linux and BSD/OSX)
#   Gnumeric
#   xsltproc
#   Java 7 JDK

# All intermediate and final data ends up in here:
PSDIR='power_station_metadata'
MANUAL_LOCATIONS='manual_station_locations.csv'
POWER_STATION_LOCATIONS_CSV='power_station_locations.csv'
